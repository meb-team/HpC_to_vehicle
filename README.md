# HpC_to_vehicle
The perl script HpC_to_vehicle retrieves the results of the perl script AccNetPhylA (files to visualize the networks, multiple alignment of Muscle, phylogenetic results of PHYLIP, ...) to create HpC (Homologous protein Cluster) and GU (Genomic Unit), to thus make different networks representing the links between "vehicles" of genes or proteins.  For each vehicle, there are two types of graphs: -network between vehicles that can belong to the same GU -network between different GU vehicles  For gene vehicle analysis, a patristic distance (calculated from tree branch lengths describe the amount of genetic change represented by a tree) will be used to build two more graphs.  In the end, there will be 4 networks resulting from an analysis with the genes and 2 from an analysis with the proteins.
